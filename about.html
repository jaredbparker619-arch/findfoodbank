<h2>About FindFoodBank</h2>
<p>
FindFoodBank is a phone based application created to help individuals and families find food banks, food pantries, and meal assistance programs in their local communities. While food assistance resources exist in many areas, finding accurate and reliable information about them is often difficult.
</p>
<p>
Many food banks have limited hours, eligibility requirements, or documentation needs that are not clearly listed online. This can result in wasted trips, confusion, and added stress for people who are already facing food insecurity. While already being low on resorces, it's difficuly to spend gas to locate these places that might now be open.
</p>
<p>
FindFoodBank solves this problem by centralizing food assistance information into one easy-to-use platform. The goal is to reduce barriers, save time, and ensure people can access food resources when they need them most.

<h2>About the Developer</h2>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Jared Parker</p>
<p><strong>Role:</strong> IT Student</p>
<p>
I created FindFoodBank based on my own experiences with food insecurity. I have personally experienced how difficult it can be to locate a food bank, determine its hours of operation, and understand the requirements needed to receive assistance.
</p>
<p>
Seeing these challenges firsthand showed me how confusing and inaccessible food assistance systems can be, especially during times of financial or personal hardship. These experiences motivated me to design a solution that makes finding help simpler and less stressful.
</p>
<p>
As an IT student, this project allowed me to combine technical skills with a real-world social issue. FindFoodBank reflects my belief that technology should be used to improve access to essential services and support people during critical moments in their lives.
